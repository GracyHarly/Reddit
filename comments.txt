Partisan Bias


It's weird that they cannot see their blatant hypocrisy.

That was a really weird line of questioning when Rosenstein was asked about Mueller's team being democrats. Even after Rosenstein explained how legal bias was different from personal bias, the Representative insisted Mueller's team was biased and I suppose the only alternative would be to put "unbiased" Republicans in charge...

Remember Ken Starr?

Hardcore partisan Republican, put there *because* he was partisan, investigated Clinton for almost all of his 8 years.

Melting snowflakes are crying up a river.

I think it would have been more fitting to illustrate them railing on other news organizations for being “unfair” and biased

I'm sitting here watching it. To me the most annoying is

- Republican Representatives listing one person after the other who has donated to the Democrats - seem to vary from $1000 to $2600;
- "would you not agree that this indicates they are not impartial and approaching this with the the required dispassion?" (or words to that effect);
- coming from Republican politicians who are passing laws and openly acknowledging they have to do so or their donors will turn their backs on them (and the many millions of dollars those donors have paid will disappear);
- while quoting text messages that are evidence in an ongoing investigation (thereby denying the individuals due process) that has been released by the DOJ inviting select members of the press to see the correspondence (with Fox news saying they have 10,000 text messages, but Democrat congressmen only have roughly 350) purely for political reasons favoring the Republicans;
- and with the same Republicans having no problems with racist law enforcers investigating (or shooting) minorities.

The rule of law is dead in the US, killed by the law makers and the President.

What about when NYT calls out the potential bias of the investigation? Hard to overlook Ohr and Strzok. 

There's only one that matters right now, and it isn't Fox's.

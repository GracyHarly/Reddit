Partisan Bias


It's weird that they cannot see their blatant hypocrisy.

That was a really weird line of questioning when Rosenstein was asked about Mueller's team being democrats. Even after Rosenstein explained how legal bias was different from personal bias, the Representative insisted Mueller's team was biased and I suppose the only alternative would be to put "unbiased" Republicans in charge...
